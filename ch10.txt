I hope you enjoyed this.

I'd like to dedicated this book to the people who took care of me in my last weeks and days.

To my sister Helen, who came from far to cook for me and stuff our fridge with food. To my mother Sheila who spent so much time in Belgium we wondered if she was going to emigrate from France. To my son Freeman who made me the best omelets. To Noemie who with the teenager's sigh made me endless hot milks, coffees, teas, and dishes to eat. To my sisters Ann and Kristien who could not often be with me, yet offered their love and support by distant phone. To Gregor who came and saw me in pain and gave me a long, silent hug. "I love you, Daddy," he said, in that embrace.

To the nurses and doctors of Unit 32 in Brugmann who I cannot cite by name, yet who hovered like protective angels over me twenty-four hours a day, catering literally to my every need.

To the nurses and doctors of the Palliative Unit in Brugmann, where I'm moving to next week.
