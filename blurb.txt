Thirty-five years I've written code, a necromancer weaving spells to bring the dead to life. Hardware and electronics never held any charm for me. I've no love for chips and cables and solder. Give me a keyboard, a screen, and a language, and you have my attention. Thirty-five years produced a lot of work. So I thought, maybe time to talk about some of those projects.
